# Come2Kids — Backend Backlog

Epics, user stories and tasks for the Come2Kids backend (Ruby on Rails API, PostgreSQL, MongoDB for activity logs, JWT, monobank test acquiring, RSpec, Rubocop).

Source: *Come2Kids — Backend API and Database Technical Requirements*. Requirement IDs (FR-…) in each story point to that document.

## How to use this file

- **Epic** → create a GitHub issue with label `epic` (or a milestone) and keep the story list as a task list.
- **User story** → create an issue with label `story`, link it to its epic, copy the *Acceptance criteria*.
- **Task** → create a sub-issue or a checklist item inside the story issue, label `task`.
- IDs: `EPIC-n`, `US-n.m`, `T-n.m.k`. Priority: **P0** must-have, **P1** should-have, **P2** later phase.
- Suggested labels: `epic`, `story`, `task`, `backend`, `db`, `api`, `security`, `payments`, `email`, `i18n`, `testing`, `P0`, `P1`, `P2`.

## Definition of Done (for every story)

- [ ] Code merged to `main` through a reviewed pull request, Rubocop passes with no offenses.
- [ ] RSpec specs cover the happy path and main error cases; CI is green.
- [ ] Endpoints are documented in OpenAPI/Swagger with request/response examples.
- [ ] Database changes are delivered as ActiveRecord migrations (reversible) and seeds are updated if needed.
- [ ] Authorization is checked on the server (role and ownership) and covered by specs.
- [ ] User-facing messages and emails exist in `uk` and `en`.
- [ ] Relevant user actions are written to the activity log (after EPIC-13 is done).

## Delivery phases

| Phase | Epics |
|---|---|
| 1. Foundation | EPIC-1, EPIC-2 |
| 2. Organizations and events | EPIC-3, EPIC-4, EPIC-5, EPIC-6 (moderation part) |
| 3. Tickets and payments | EPIC-7, EPIC-8, EPIC-9, EPIC-10 |
| 4. Community and engagement | EPIC-11, EPIC-12, EPIC-13, EPIC-14, EPIC-6 (blocking, appeals) |
| 5. Hardening and later features | EPIC-15, EPIC-16 |

As a developer, I want a runnable Rails API project with PostgreSQL, so that the team can start feature work.

**Acceptance criteria**
- `rails new` in API mode, Ruby and Rails versions pinned, project builds from a clean clone.
- Docker Compose starts the Rails app, PostgreSQL and MongoDB with one command.
- Configuration comes from environment variables; `.env.example` is committed, secrets are not.

- [ ] T-1.1.5 Write README with setup instructions

### US-1.2 CI pipeline and code quality — P0
As a developer, I want automatic checks on every pull request, so that broken or badly formatted code is not merged.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Test coverage report is produced (SimpleCov).

**Tasks**
- [ ] T-1.2.1 Add the GitHub Actions workflow (Rubocop, RSpec, PostgreSQL service)
- [ ] T-1.2.2 Add `.rubocop.yml` agreed by the team and fix existing offenses

## Dependency overview

1. EPIC-1 → everything else.
2. EPIC-2 (authentication, authorization) → EPIC-3 … EPIC-16.
3. EPIC-3 and EPIC-4 tables → EPIC-5 → EPIC-6 (moderation) → public catalog shows real data.
4. EPIC-5 (events and ticket types) → EPIC-7 → EPIC-8 → EPIC-9 → EPIC-10.
5. EPIC-13 (US-13.1) should start early, because all emails and messages depend on locale handling.
6. EPIC-14 can start after EPIC-2; instrumentation is added gradually as features appear.
7. EPIC-12 depends on EPIC-6 (approval events) and EPIC-9 (emails); EPIC-15 depends on EPIC-3.
